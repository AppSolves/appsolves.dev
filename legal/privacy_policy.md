## 1. Scope and Acceptance

By accessing or using any of the Services you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and consent to the practices described herein. This Privacy Policy governs all personal data collected or processed by AppSolves across all websites, apps, and products offered now or in the future.

## 2. Types of Data We Collect

We collect a variety of information in order to provide, improve, secure, and support the Services. Types of personal data we collect include:

**2.1 Personal and Account Information**

* Full name, email address, phone number, postal address (where provided), and other contact or profile data.
* Account credentials (username, hashed password), linked third-party account data and tokens, and account metadata.

**2.2 Device, Technical & Usage Data**

* IP address, device identifiers, operating system, browser type and version, device model, network information, precise location data (where permission is granted), cookies, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), and other tracking identifiers (including advertising IDs).
* App and website usage data (pages viewed, features used, clicks, session duration), performance metrics, and crash logs.

**2.3 Payment & Billing Data**

* Payment and billing data necessary for purchases and subscriptions (e.g., payment tokens, transaction metadata). AppSolves relies on third-party payment processors such as Stripe to store and process raw payment card details. We do **not** store raw credit card numbers or full payment credentials on our servers; where we receive payment tokens or truncated card information (e.g., last-4 digits), this will be retained as described below.

**2.4 Analytics and Advertising Data**

* Aggregated analytics, advertising identifiers (ad-IDs), and profiling data used for analytics, advertising, and measurement.

We process personal data for the following purposes and on the legal bases described below:

**3.1 To provide and maintain the Services** — performance of a contract (e.g., account management, subscriptions, payments).
**3.2 To operate, improve and analyze the Services** — legitimate interests (product improvement, debugging, analytics, performance monitoring, crash reporting, fraud detection, and security).
**3.3 For customer support and communication** — performance of a contract and/or legitimate interests.
**3.4 For billing, invoicing and record-keeping** — legal obligation and performance of a contract.

## 4. Legal Bases (GDPR)

Where applicable under the GDPR, our legal bases for processing personal data include:

* **Performance of a contract** (providing Services, billing, subscriptions).
* **Legitimate interests** (product improvement, security, fraud detection, analytics), provided such interests do not override your fundamental rights.
* **Consent** (for targeted advertising, marketing communications, or any processing where consent is required by law). When we rely on consent, you may withdraw it at any time as described below.

## 5. Cookies, Tracking & Consent

We use cookies, local storage, JWTs, and similar technologies for authentication, functionality, analytics, security, and marketing. Cookies and tracking technologies may be categorized as functional, analytical, or marketing. At present, our website and apps may not display a full consent banner on every product; however, we intend to implement a consent mechanism on our website in the future. Where required by law, we will request consent for marketing and certain analytics cookies. You may manage cookies via your browser or device settings; disabling certain cookies may affect functionality.

## 6. Third-Party Processors and Data Sharing

We share personal data with third parties strictly as necessary to provide the Services or for legitimate business purposes. Typical categories of recipients include:

* **Payment processors:** e.g., Stripe — for payment processing and billing. We do not store raw card numbers; payment processors handle card data.
* **Analytics & crash reporting providers:** e.g., Firebase, Google Analytics — for product analytics and crash reporting.
* **Advertising partners:** e.g., Google ad partners — for ad delivery, measurement, and targeting. Personalized ads may be served.
* **Hosting and infrastructure providers:** cloud and hosting vendors used to operate the Services.
* **Professional services providers:** auditors, lawyers, accountants, and other service providers.
* **Legal and safety recipients:** when required to comply with legal processes, to protect rights, property, or safety, or to respond to lawful requests.

Where transfers outside the European Economic Area (EEA) occur, data may be processed in countries with differing data protection laws. AppSolves will, where feasible, use appropriate safeguards (e.g., EU Standard Contractual Clauses) or rely on other lawful transfer mechanisms. By using the Services you consent to such transfers as described.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes listed above and in accordance with applicable law. Typical retention periods are:

* **Account & profile data:** retained while the account exists and for **1 year** after a period of inactivity.
* **Payment & billing records:** retained for **7 years** for accounting, tax, and legal purposes.
* **Logs, IP addresses, crash reports:** retained for **12 months**.
* **Analytics (aggregated):** retained for **24 months**.

Please note: while we use these retention periods as a guideline, we cannot absolutely guarantee deletion within these windows in every case. Practical factors — including technical, administrative, or personnel limitations — may lead to longer retention in some circumstances.

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have legal rights regarding your personal data, including the right to:

* Access a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
* Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.
* Request deletion of your personal data (right to be forgotten) subject to legal exceptions.
* Request restriction of processing.
* Object to processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing.
* Request portability of certain personal data you provided.
* Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.

**Important:** Although these rights exist under law (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), AppSolves currently does **not** provide fully automated self-service tools to access, update, or delete your data. If you wish to exercise any rights, please contact us at [contact@appsolves.dev](mailto:contact@appsolves.dev) with sufficient details and verification information. We will consider and respond to manual requests in good faith, but please be aware that manual processing may take time and we are not guaranteeing immediate fulfillment.

## 9. Security

We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These safeguards include secure backends and servers, authentication mechanisms, rate limiting, limited access within our team, and encryption of local user data in most apps. Despite these measures, no system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. If a security incident affecting your personal data occurs, we will take steps to investigate and remediate and, where required by law, notify affected individuals and authorities.

---

## 10. Minors

Our Services are not intended to be used by young children. Users should be at least **13 years old**, and where applicable under local law (for example, GDPR member states), the minimum age is **16 years**. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children below these ages. If we become aware that a child below the applicable minimum age has provided personal data, we will take reasonable steps to delete such data.

---

## 11. Marketing and Communications

We may use contact information to send service-related messages and — where you have given consent or where permitted by law — marketing communications. You may opt out of marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions in those emails or by contacting [contact@appsolves.dev](mailto:contact@appsolves.dev). Even if you opt out of marketing communications, we may still send you non-promotional messages concerning the Services (e.g., transactional or account notices).

---

## 12. Automated Decision-Making & Profiling

We may engage in automated analysis for analytics, personalization, advertising delivery, and fraud prevention. Personalized advertising and profiling **may** be used by our advertising partners. Where required by law, you have the right to request meaningful information about the logic involved and to object to certain forms of automated decision-making.

## 13. Changes to This Privacy Policy
